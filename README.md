### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# My name is Samuel. I'm a developer from Brazil. Passionate for programming, _Linux_, problem solving and âœ¨ _learning_ âœ¨.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some hobby projects, such as [FÃªnix RobÃ³tica](https://github.com/r47orr/fenix-robotica-js) and [Math](https://github.com/r47orr/math).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, C# and improving on JavaScript
- ðŸ‘€ I'm very interested on Linux and I'm all the time taking a look at [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
- ðŸ‘¯ I'd love to be able to collaborate to the [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), but I'm still very far from having that level
